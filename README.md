Overview

This repository contains my inaugural SQL project, leveraging MySQL for data analysis and Power BI for data visualization. The project is based on the "Danny's Diner" case study from 8WeekSQLChallenge.com

Project Highlights

Database Creation: Designed and implemented a relational database from scratch.
Data Management: Performed table updates, data cleaning, and formatting using SQL queries.
Advanced SQL Techniques: Utilized joins and subqueries.
Data Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards and insightful graphics using Power BI.

Tools Used

MySQL
Power BI

Repository Structure


/database: SQL scripts for database creation and data insertion
/queries: SQL queries used for analysis
/powerbi: Power BI files and exported visualizations
/results: Summary of findings and insights
